## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of **autonomous sensor nodes** capable of long-term operation using onboard power supplies. The sensor nodes are designed to independently acquire, process, and transmit sensor data, targeting applications in wearable, industrial, and medical electronics.

Two types of sensor nodes were developed in this project:
- **Photoplethysmography (PPG) Sensor Node**
- **Accelerometer (ACC) Sensor Node**

Each sensor node integrates sensing elements, power management, and a microcontroller unit (MCU) with its peripheral circuitry.
